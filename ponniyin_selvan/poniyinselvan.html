			<h2>Arul Mozhivarman</h2>
			<p>Rajaraja I, born Arulmoli Varman, often described as Rajaraja the Great, was a Chola emperor (reigned c. 985â€“1014) chiefly remembered for reinstating the Chola power and ensuring its supremacy in south India and Indian Ocean.

His extensive empire included the Pandya country (southern Tamil Nadu), the Chera country (central Kerala and western Tamil Nadu) and northern Sri Lanka. He also acquired the Lakshadweep and Maldive Islands in the Indian Ocean. Campaigns against the Western Gangas (southern Karnataka) and Chalukyas extended the Chola influence as far as the Tungabhadra River. On the eastern coast he battled with the Chalukyas for the possession of Vengi (the Godavari districts).[6][7][8][9]

Rajaraja, an able administrator, also built the great Brihadisvara Temple at the Chola capital Thanjavur.[10] The temple is regarded as the foremost of all temples in the medieval south Indian architectural style. During his reign, the texts of the Tamil poets Appar, Sambandar and Sundarar were collected and edited into one compilation called Thirumurai.[7][11] He initiated a massive project of land survey and assessment in 1000 CE which led to the reorganisation of the country into individual units known as valanadus.[12][13] Rajaraja died in 1014 CE and was succeeded by his son Rajendra Chola I.</p>

			<h2>Vanthiyadevan</h2>

Territory under his authority was known as Vallavaraiyanadu. He ruled Brahmadesam.[2] Vandiyathevan is idealized in Kalki Krishnamurthy's (Kalki) famous novel Ponniyin Selvan and also in many other novels like Vandiyadevan Vaal, Vandiyadevan Senai thalaivan.
			Vandhiyadevan is one of the key characters of the novel Ponniyin Selvan. The author Kalki Krishnamurthy depicts him as a brave, adventurous and sarcastic warrior/prince of Bana clan, who later becomes the Commander for Southern Troops under the reign of Uttama Chola. Although the second protagonist of the story other than Ponniyin Selvan himself, Vandiyadevan's exploits make the readers to think him as the main hero at multiple points in the novel. He was a bodyguard and close friend of Aditya Karikalan in Kanchi who sends him as a messenger to Sundara Chola in Thanjavur to invite him to the newly built golden palace in Kanchi and also as a trustful guard for Kundavai in Pazhayarai. His unplanned and hasteful acts put himself and others in danger but comes out of them by trickery and luck. He is the lover of Princess Kundavai.

			<h2>Alvarkadiyan nambi</h2>

He works closely with him and saves him from many dangers. He was a loyal trustful servant for the Chola royal government. He often does many religious word battles with Veera Shaivites and Advaitis.
			He is in his late thirties or fourties during the storyline..
Kalki claims hes vaishnavaite but his cousin brother Esanasivapattar is Saivate...

Sembiyan madhevi gives this family the young girl nandhini so he is young in his late teens and brings her up as his own sister....he does get impressed by her ability to sing andals songs and things shes andal herself.....and would offer the same impact on people like Andal...He is dissapointed when she leaves them to go with Pazhuvettarayar and Ravidaasan...He tries to bring her back...and make her realise that shes doing wrong...He doesnt have any carnal desires towards her ( nandhini once says to VD oh he wants me to marry him and raise kids to spread vaishnavism)
