According to historical and archaeological records, the temple was originally built around 6th century AD and the major portion of it was damaged in 14th century by the Muslim invaders in India. The present structure of the temple dates back to 16th century when it was again restored to its pristine glory by the Nayak rulers.</p>

Besides gopurams, intricately carved figures and scenes depicted from Indian mythology in the halls add to the artistic charm of the temple.
